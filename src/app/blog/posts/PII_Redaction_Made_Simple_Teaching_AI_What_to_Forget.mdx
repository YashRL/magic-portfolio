# PII Redaction Made Simple: Teaching AI What to Forget

## Introduction

Modern AI systems are becoming incredibly powerful. They read documents, summarize conversations, search the internet, reason over knowledge, and even act on our behalf. But with this power comes a very human problem:

**AI remembers too much.**

Emails, phone numbers, Aadhaar IDs, bank details, addresses — all of these are casually embedded inside documents, chat logs, PDFs, support tickets, and databases. Humans intuitively know what should remain private. Machines don’t.

This is where **PII Redaction** comes in.

In this article, I’ll explain PII redaction **without legal jargon**, **without security fear-mongering**, and **without overengineering**. We’ll understand *why* it exists, *how* it works at a conceptual level, and finally *how to build one yourself* using a very small Python example powered by **Microsoft Presidio**.

The goal is not just to copy code — but to **build intuition**.

## What Is PII (Personally Identifiable Information)?

PII stands for **Personally Identifiable Information**.

In simple words:

> PII is any piece of information that can identify a real human being.
> 

Some examples are obvious:

- Full names
- Phone numbers
- Email addresses
- Government IDs
- Bank account numbers

Some are less obvious:

- IP addresses
- Device IDs
- Location data
- Internal employee IDs
- Combination of seemingly harmless data points

Think of PII like **digital fingerprints**. Individually they may look harmless, but together they point to *you*.

Now here’s the important part:

> PII is not dangerous by default.
It becomes dangerous when it flows into systems that were never meant to remember it forever.
> 

And modern AI systems are exactly that kind of system.

## Why PII Redaction Is Necessary in Modern Agentic AI Systems

Agentic AI systems are different from traditional software.

They don’t just:

- Read once
- Process once
- Forget

Instead, they:

- Store memory
- Retrieve context
- Chain reasoning across steps
- Call tools
- Share intermediate outputs
- Learn from previous interactions

Now imagine this scenario:

A support agent uploads a customer conversation:

> “Hi, my name is Yash and my phone number is 9876543210.”
> 

An AI agent:

- Extracts intent
- Stores conversation memory
- Indexes the text in a vector database
- Sends context to another agent
- Logs output for evaluation
- Uses it later for training or analytics

Suddenly, **one phone number is duplicated across multiple systems**.

That’s not just a privacy issue — it’s an architectural problem.

### Why redaction must happen *before* intelligence

The key insight is this:

> Once PII enters an agent’s memory, you’ve already lost control.
> 

So PII redaction must happen:

- Before embedding
- Before storage
- Before logging
- Before tool execution
- Before agent-to-agent communication

In agentic systems, **redaction is not a compliance layer — it’s a core infrastructure layer**.

## How PII Redaction Works (The Theory, Explained Simply)

At a conceptual level, PII redaction is a **three-step pipeline**:

Architecture of a PII Readction System

### 1. Understanding Language (NLP Layer)

First, the system must understand text like a human:

- What is a name?
- What looks like a phone number?
- What pattern resembles an ID?

This is done using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models.

Modern systems use transformer-based models (like spaCy transformers) that understand *context*, not just keywords.

### 2. Recognizing Patterns (Detection Layer)

Once language is understood, we apply **recognizers**.

Recognizers are like detectives:

- Some are **ML-based** (contextual understanding)
- Some are **rule-based** (regex, patterns)

For example:

- A phone number in India has structure
- A bank account has format
- A passport follows a pattern

Combining **context + patterns** dramatically reduces false positives.

### 3. Anonymizing or Redacting (Action Layer)

Once PII is detected, we don’t delete text.

Instead, we:

- Replace it with placeholders
- Mask it
- Hash it
- Tokenize it

Example:

```
"My phone number is 9876543210" 
->  
"My phone number is <PHONE_NUMBER>"
```

This preserves:

- Sentence structure
- Meaning
- Context for AI reasoning

But removes:

- Identity
- Risk
- Leakage

## Building a Simple PII Redaction System in Python

Now let’s build one.

This example uses **Microsoft Presidio**, which is designed exactly for this problem.

### Step 1: NLP Engine (Understanding Language)

We use spaCy’s transformer model for high-quality language understanding.

```python
from presidio_analyzer.nlp_engineimport NlpEngineProvider

config = {
"nlp_engine_name":"spacy",
"models": [{"lang_code":"en","model_name":"en_core_web_trf"}],
}

provider = NlpEngineProvider(nlp_configuration=config)
nlp_engine = provider.create_engine()
```

Think of this as giving your system **eyes and ears**.

---

### Step 2: Recognizer Registry (What to Look For)

Presidio comes with many predefined recognizers. But real systems need customization.

```python
from presidio_analyzerimport RecognizerRegistry

registry = RecognizerRegistry()
registry.load_predefined_recognizers()
```

Now we remove noisy recognizers that don’t apply to our context:

```python
REMOVE = [
"NhsRecognizer",
"UsBankRecognizer",
"UsLicenseRecognizer",
]

for namein REMOVE:
    registry.remove_recognizer(name)
```

This is important.

**More recognizers ≠ better detection.
Relevant recognizers = better precision.**

---

### Step 3: Custom Indian Phone Number Recognizer

Instead of a generic phone detector, we define a **strict Indian format**.

```python
from presidio_analyzerimport Pattern, PatternRecognizer

indian_phone_pattern = Pattern(
    name="indian_phone",
    regex=r"\b[6-9]\d{9}\b",
    score=0.7,
)

indian_phone_recognizer = PatternRecognizer(
    supported_entity="PHONE_NUMBER",
    patterns=[indian_phone_pattern],
)

registry.remove_recognizer("PhoneRecognizer")
registry.add_recognizer(indian_phone_recognizer)
```

This small change massively improves accuracy.

---

### Step 4: Analyzer Engine (Detect PII)

```python
from presidio_analyzerimport AnalyzerEngine

analyzer = AnalyzerEngine(
    nlp_engine=nlp_engine,
    registry=registry,
)
```

Now we test it:

```python
text ="yash and my phone number is 9876543210."

results = analyzer.analyze(text=text, language="en")
```

Output:

```
type:PHONE_NUMBER,start:28,end:38,score:0.7
```

Your system now **knows where PII lives**.

---

### Step 5: Anonymization (Redaction)

```python
from presidio_anonymizerimport AnonymizerEngine

anonymizer = AnonymizerEngine()
anonymized = anonymizer.anonymize(
    text=text,
    analyzer_results=results
)

print(anonymized.text)
```

Final output:

```
yashand my phone numberis <PHONE_NUMBER>.
```

That’s it.

No overengineering.

No black magic.

Just clean architecture.

## Final Thoughts: Why This Matters More Than Ever

PII redaction is not about hiding information.

It’s about **respecting boundaries between intelligence and identity**.

As AI systems become:

- More autonomous
- More persistent
- More interconnected

The cost of ignoring privacy multiplies.

If you’re building:

- Agentic workflows
- RAG systems
- Memory-enabled assistants
- Enterprise AI platforms

Then **PII redaction should be one of the first systems you design — not the last one you patch in**.

The best AI systems aren’t the ones that remember everything.

They’re the ones that know **what to forget**.
